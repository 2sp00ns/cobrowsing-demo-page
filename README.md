# demo.surfly.com – Co-Browsing Demo
- View the live demo at [demo.surfly.com](https://demo.surfly.com)
- Also features on Surfly main website [surfly.com/try-surfly](https://www.surfly.com/try-surfly) 

A minimal demo page that visually explains **Surfly co-browsing**.

The page displays **two iframes side by side**. Each iframe represents a different participant in the same co-browsing session (for example, a customer and an agent). This makes it immediately clear that Surfly enables **shared browsing**, not screen sharing — two real users, one shared experience.

Both participants:
- Join via their **own Surfly session link**
- See the **same shared webpage**
- Stay fully synchronized while browsing

The demo is built using the **Surfly JavaScript API**. A session is created programmatically, unique participant URLs are generated, and each URL is loaded into an iframe.
